## Requirements

This section describes the features of the application.

### Definition of MVP
An MVP is the initial version of a product that includes just enough features to be usable by early customers. The goal is to collect validated learning about customers with the least effort. In other words, itâ€™s the version of a product that allows a team to observe actual customer behavior and determine whether people will actually use or purchase the product. The key premise behind an MVP is that seeing what people do with the product is more reliable than asking them what they would do.
